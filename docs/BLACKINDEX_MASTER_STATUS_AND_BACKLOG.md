# BlackIndex — Living Status, Completion Ledger, and Backlog

**Status:** Authoritative project-progress ledger  
**Updated:** 2026-08-27  
**Purpose:** Keep completed work visible while preserving the remaining research and implementation backlog.

> Completion here means the currently defined ingestion, review, or implementation milestone was reached. It does **not** mean the underlying historical question is resolved.

## Status legend

- `COMPLETE` — implemented or acquired/reviewed to the current milestone
- `ACTIVE` — in use and being extended
- `PARTIAL` — meaningful work exists; cluster/capability remains incomplete
- `PREPARED` — ingestion/code path exists; local execution or review still required
- `QUEUED` — explicitly in backlog; not yet materially implemented/ingested
- `HOLD` — deliberately paused pending a review/dependency
- `SUPERSEDED` — older implementation/acquisition target retained for history but replaced by a better current path

## Corpus checkpoint

- Authoritative local verifier checkpoint: **33 checked / 0 failures** (`2026-08-27` official-closeout run)
- Historical Milestone 1: **25 verified / 0 failures**
- Operation Encore underlying-record acquisition: **4 / 4** large FBI artifacts acquired/resumed successfully
- Joint Inquiry final report is acquired/published as `US CONGRESS-2002-9-11-joint-inquiry-001`
- 9/11 Commission Final Report is acquired/published as `COMMISSION-2004-9-11-commission-001`
- CIA OIG 9/11 Accountability is acquired/published as `CIA-2005-9-11-cia-accountability-001`
- Raw source artifacts remain local-only
- GitHub stores metadata/provenance, reviewed extractions, evidence-map objects, lineage, schemas, governance, tooling, and controlled-run reports

The local verifier remains authoritative for raw-corpus integrity.

## Controlled Sprint — 2026-08-27 — 9/11 Official-Layer Closeout

**Initial sprint script:** `tools/ingest-phase2-911-official-closeout.sh`  
**Initial run report:** `docs/run-reports/2026-08-27-911-official-closeout.md`  
**Collision-safe resume:** `tools/ingest-phase2-911-official-closeout-resume.sh`  
**Review gate:** `docs/reviews/phase2-cross-document-007-911-official-closeout.md`

### Initial run result

- Successful/resumed calls: **2 / 4**
- Authoritative verifier: **33 checked / 0 failures**
- 9/11 Commission Final Report: already present; duplicate-by-hash resume succeeded
- CIA OIG Accountability: newly acquired/published successfully
- Both Commission staff monographs: acquisition bytes downloaded successfully, but intake stopped on an existing immutable `...staff-monographs-001.pdf` destination
- The collision is an intake namespace/local-state issue, not a source-acquisition failure

### Recovery decision

Do **not** delete, rename, or overwrite the existing immutable raw artifact merely to free the `-001` slot. The recovery pass assigns distinct canonical collection namespaces to the Financing and Travel monographs. This preserves the existing artifact for later audit and gives each monograph an unambiguous durable document ID.

### Sprint stop gate

Do **not** count repeated statements across Joint Inquiry, Commission staff work, Commission final report, CIA OIG, and Operation Encore as independent corroboration until source genealogy is mapped.

## Current operational order

1. Run `tools/ingest-phase2-911-official-closeout-resume.sh` on the local BlackIndex vault.
2. Read its durable resume report from GitHub; no manual terminal transcription should be required.
3. If verifier remains clean, update the two staff monographs from `PREPARED` to `PARTIAL` with their document IDs.
4. Start cross-document review 007 with Bayoumi / Thumairy / Hazmi-Mihdhar wording and source dependencies.
5. Encode source genealogy before treating repeated official statements as independent corroboration.
6. Preserve negative findings as attributed investigator/institution conclusions with exact wording and scope.
7. Address the CIA OIG `pdf-no-text-layer` condition with a deliberate review/extraction path; do not silently OCR during intake.
8. Implement the physical PDF page mapper before treating FBI segment indices as physical page citations.
9. After the 9/11 comparison gate, default next corpus expansion is Operation LOOKING GLASS.
10. Discovery objects, Capability Registry, Toka, and Bentov/Gateway remain queued platform/research work after the current corpus gate.

## Completion logging rule

**Never delete a completed backlog item.** Change its state instead:

`QUEUED → PREPARED → PARTIAL/ACTIVE → COMPLETE`

Use `SUPERSEDED` when an older target/path remains historically relevant but a safer or more authoritative replacement becomes the active path.

When possible, attach completion evidence:

- document IDs
- commit SHA
- verifier result
- extraction/review path
- evidence-map objects created
- known limitations/open questions

This file is the durable project-progress ledger. The full living methodology should carry this same completion state so BlackIndex can reconstruct how both the corpus and the method evolved over time.
